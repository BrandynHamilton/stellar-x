"""
Stellar uses signatures as authorization. Transactions always need authorization
from at least one public key in order to be considered valid. Generally,
transactions only need authorization from the public key of the source account.

Transaction signatures are created by cryptographically signing the
transaction object contents with a secret key. Stellar currently uses the ed25519 signature
scheme, but thereâ€™s also a mechanism for adding additional types of public/private key schemes.
A transaction with an attached signature is considered to have authorization from that public key.

In two cases, a transaction may need more than one signature. If the transaction has
operations that affect more than one account, it will need authorization from every account
in question. A transaction will also need additional signatures if the account associated
with the transaction has multiple public keys.

See: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/multisig/
